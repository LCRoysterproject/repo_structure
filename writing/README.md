This is the `writing` folder structure outline. The `writing` folder will include all writing relevant to this specific repository project.  
  
### Naming Standards  
Every folder and writing document is required to be in lowercase, no uppercase (camelcase) nor all caps, all names with separate words need to include a underscore ( _ ), no dates in the names unless it helps with the descriptions of the content (e.g., fl_afs_abstract_2019.docx, repo_name_manuscript.docx, bp_repo_name_edits.docx, lcr_quarterly_report_spring_2019.pdf).  
   
Optional folders in `writing` could be:  
- abstract (for paper, conferences, etc)  
- manuscript (thesis, journal article, chapter, etc)  
- edits (edits received for any writing)  
- report (usually an output or compilation for meeting, conference, or internal)  
- figure_descriptions
