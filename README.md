# repo_structure
This is the mandatory framework repository to outline all new GitHub repositories in the LCR project. The outlined structure of this repository can be downloaded and copied at the start of a new repository. A repository is specific to an individual project within the LCR project. Each repository is stand alone, and not reliant on any other repository.  
  
### Naming Standards  
Every folder and file is required to be in lowercase, no uppercase (camelcase) nor all caps, all names with separate words need to include a underscore ( _ ), no dates in the names unless it helps with the descriptions of the content (i.e., discharge_1941_2018_fig.tiff, landings_1986_2018_analysis.R).  
  
Mandatory folders for all repositories are, which are included in this skeleton repo structure:  
- data  
- figures (`figures` includes tables and figures used for writing and presentations)  
- script  
- writing  
  
Each of the above mandatory folders include naming conventions and additional optional/mandatory folders. Every folder **MUST** contain a README.md that will describe the folder and its contents. The README.md **MUST** also include file usage information, if necessary. 
  
### RPRoject (repo_structure.Rproj)  
  
Every repository is required to have an Rproject. An Rproject is used to create an ecosystem that connects all folders and files within the respository.
