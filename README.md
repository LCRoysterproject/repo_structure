# repo_structure
This is a fake repository to outline repository structure/framework/skeleton.  

Every folder and file is required to be in lowercase, no uppercase (camelcase) or all caps, all names with separate words need to include a underscore ( _ ), no dates in the names unless it helps with the descriptions of the content (i.e, discharge_1941_2018_fig.tiff, landings_1986_2018_analysis.R).  
  
Mandatory folders for all repositories are, which are included in this skeleton repo structure:  
-data  
-figures  
-script  
-writing
