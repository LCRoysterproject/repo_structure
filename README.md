# repo_structure
This is the mandatory framework repository to outline all new GitHub repositories in the LCR project. The outlined structure of this repository can be downloaded and copied at the start of a new repository. A repository is specific to an individual project within the LCR project. Each repository is stand alone, and not reliant on any other repository.  

Every folder and file is required to be in lowercase, no uppercase (camelcase) or all caps, all names with separate words need to include a underscore ( _ ), no dates in the names unless it helps with the descriptions of the content (i.e., discharge_1941_2018_fig.tiff, landings_1986_2018_analysis.R).  
  
Mandatory folders for all repositories are, which are included in this skeleton repo structure:  
- data  
- figures  
- script  
- writing  
  
 * `figures` includes tables and figures used for writing and presentations.
