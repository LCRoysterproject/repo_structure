This is the `data` folder structure outline. The `data` folder will include all data relevant to this specific repository project.  

Mandatory folders in `data` are:  
- archive  
The `archive` folder consists of any raw datasets used to update the repository master dataset. 

Allowable optional folders in `data` could be:  
- water  
- heights  
- counts 
- transect  
- shell_biomass 
  
It is recommended only to add additional folders if there are more than 10 different datasets (this is **NOT** normal for one individual repository project).
